# Longitudinal AI Governance Whitepaper

Role: Narrative explanation of longitudinal AI governance concepts

Depends On: Hollow_House_Standards_Library, HHI_GOV_01 (conceptual)  
Does Not Define: Canonical terminology, governance standards, licensing terms, datasets  
Governance Status: Supporting

Authority Links:
- Hollow_House_Standards_Library (canonical definitions authority)

## Purpose

This repository contains the Hollow House Institute whitepaper describing
**longitudinal governance risks in AI-mediated organizations**.

It exists to explain:
- how governance risk accumulates over time
- why point-in-time controls are insufficient
- how behavioral drift becomes infrastructure

This document is explanatory, not authoritative.

---

## Scope

This repository may include:
- narrative analysis
- diagrams and conceptual models
- references to governance standards and research

This repository does not:
- define canonical terminology
- establish governance controls
- issue audit findings
- provide compliance determinations
- certify AI systems or organizations

---

## Authority Boundaries

All terminology defers to the Hollow_House_Standards_Library.

Any governance claims must defer to Tier 1 artifacts
(especially HHI_GOV_01 and HHI_Interaction_Controls).

This whitepaper may reference standards but may not extend or reinterpret them.

---

## Status

Tier 2 supporting reference artifact.  
Non-authoritative by design.

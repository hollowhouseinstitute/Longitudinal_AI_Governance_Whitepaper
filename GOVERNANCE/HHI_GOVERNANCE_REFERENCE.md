# Governance Reference

This repository inherits governance authority from:

HHI Governance Export — Core

The governance export defines:
- execution authority (HHIGOV01)
- continuity and research inheritance
- language and licensing constraints
- audit and drift boundaries

Local documentation does not supersede canonical governance.

Alignment is required for use, contribution, or derivative works.
